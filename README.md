## Project Overview

The Online Examination System is a comprehensive web application designed to modernize academic assessments. It provides educational institutions with a secure, efficient, and user-friendly platform for creating exams, conducting tests, and managing results. The system streamlines the entire examination lifecycle, from question creation by teachers to real-time exam-taking by students and automated grading, all while upholding academic integrity.

This project was developed as a group project for a Database Management Systems course, demonstrating a strong understanding of database design, web development, and software engineering principles.

### Key Objectives
- To provide a secure and reliable platform for conducting online examinations.
- To empower teachers with tools for efficient exam and question bank management.
- To offer students a seamless and fair exam-taking experience with features like real-time timers.
- To automate the grading process and provide insightful result analysis.
- To ensure academic integrity through robust security and monitoring features.

## System Architecture & Database Schema

The system is built on a normalized relational database schema designed for scalability and data integrity.

### Main Tables
`User` (Custom), `Student`, `Teacher`, `Department`, `Subject`, `Question`, `Exam`, `ExamAttempt`, `StudentExamResult`

### Key Relationships
- A `User` has a one-to-one relationship with either a `Student` or a `Teacher`. This allows for a unified authentication system while separating role-specific data.
- An `Exam` belongs to one `Department` and one `Subject`.
- An `Exam` is composed of many `Questions` ($ \text{Many-to-Many relationship} $).
- An `ExamAttempt` represents a student's single attempt at an `Exam`.
- A `StudentExamResult` links a `Student` to their final score on an `Exam`.

### Constraints
- Primary Keys defined for all tables.
- Foreign Key relationships are established with `ON DELETE CASCADE` or `ON DELETE SET NULL` where appropriate to maintain referential integrity.
- `UNIQUE` constraints on usernames, email addresses, and department codes.
- `UNIQUE TOGETHER` constraints to prevent a student from attempting the same exam multiple times.

## Key Learnings & Technical Challenges

This project provided invaluable hands-on experience and presented several technical challenges that were successfully overcome:

1.  **Advanced Authentication & Authorization:**
    * **Challenge:** Implementing a secure authentication system that could handle different user roles (Admin, Teacher, Student) with distinct permissions.
    * **Solution:** Developed a custom Django User model and leveraged Django's built-in authentication system. Implemented role-based access control using decorators and middleware to protect routes and functionalities, ensuring a secure and segregated user experience.

2.  **Dynamic Frontend with Django Templates:**
    * **Challenge:** Integrating a static HTML/CSS frontend with the Django backend, making it dynamic and data-driven.
    * **Solution:** Mastered the Django Templating Language (DTL), including template inheritance, context processors, and custom template tags. This allowed for the creation of reusable UI components and a clean separation of logic and presentation.

3.  **Complex Database Relationships:**
    * **Challenge:** Designing an efficient and normalized database schema, particularly for handling the many-to-many relationship between exams and questions.
    * **Solution:** Designed the schema using ER modeling principles. Implemented the `ManyToManyField` in Django to create the association table between `Exam` and `Question`. Utilized database cascading rules to ensure data integrity during deletion operations.

4.  **Real-time Functionality with JavaScript:**
    * **Challenge:** Implementing a real-time exam timer and handling asynchronous form submissions without full page reloads.
    * **Solution:** Utilized JavaScript to create a countdown timer for the exam interface. For future enhancements, developed a plan to integrate the AJAX/Fetch API to submit answers and update the UI asynchronously, improving user experience.
